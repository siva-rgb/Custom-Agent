    can answer iteration differently from what it holds); the source bounded text.

    A source that is a str subclass is copied into the exact text it holds and
    bounded on the copy (FR-47): refusing it was a regression M10 introduced for
    ordinary caller code (KNOWLEDGE-739aca22), and a subclass reporting a false
    length is measured by what it holds.
