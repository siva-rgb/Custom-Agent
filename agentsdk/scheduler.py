"""Concurrency limits (FR-43, FR-44, FR-46, ADR-30).

Budget answers "can we afford this"; `SchedulerLimits` answers "is it safe to
run this many things at once" (design v0.3), and a run can be affordable and
still unsafe to fan out unbounded. M11 adds the three limits Phase 2's first
increment needs. The fields the design names for the orchestrator
(max_concurrent_subagents, max_tasks_per_run, queue_policy) arrive with the
second increment and are deliberately not reserved here.
