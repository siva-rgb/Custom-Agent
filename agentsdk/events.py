"""Runtime events (ADR-21, LLD 2.3, 4.12).

`RunEvent` is the ordered audit/telemetry stream. It is NOT the source of
execution truth: `runs` + `messages` are authoritative, and a trace reconstructs
from persisted state PLUS ordered events together (NFR-3).

The envelope carries identifiers Phase 0 never populates -- agent_id, task_id,
attempt_id, parent_event_id, correlation_id -- so Phase 2's subagents and
Phase 6's execution attempts add values, not columns.
