"""Run handles: a run already under way, its events as they happen, and cancellation
(FR-48, FR-49, FR-50).

`Runner.start` returns a `RunHandle` for a run it has started without waiting for
it; `Runner.run` is a run started that way and awaited to its end. A run belongs to
the event loop that started it.

Cancellation is cooperative (DECISION-29e21dd0). Asking for it marks the run and,
when the run is waiting on something that can be interrupted -- a model call, a
provider slot, a tool, a slot for a tool -- cancels the run's task so that wait ends.
Store writes are never interrupted: one already started finishes, and the run then
stops at its next checkpoint, before any further model or tool call starts. A tool
that catches `CancelledError` and carries on delays the end of its run for as long
as it runs.
