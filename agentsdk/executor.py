"""The tool-call lifecycle (FR-5, FR-44, LLD 3.5).

Nine steps, fixed order:

    1 resolve  2 validate  3 permission  4 approval (stub)  5 before_tool
    6 execute  7 assign provenance  8 after_tool  9 emit ToolCalled

INVARIANT: a call that fails validation never reaches the permission check, and
a denied call never reaches execution. That ordering is the difference between
"we checked" and "we checked in time", so it is asserted in the tests rather
than trusted to code reading.

Since M11 the steps are also reachable as two halves: `prepare` runs 1 to 5 and
`run_prepared` runs 6 to 9, because a parallel batch prepares every one of its
calls before any of them executes (FR-44). `execute` is the two halves in a row,
which is the lifecycle it always was. Each half is a total boundary of its own.

A failed tool call is a normal turn outcome, not a run failure: every failure
below still produces a ToolResult with is_error=True so the model sees it and
can react on its next turn (LLD 4.2, 4.3).
