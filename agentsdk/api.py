"""The public API (FR-1, FR-48, NFR-5, LLD 3.3).

`Runner.run()` is the only method most application code calls. Everything else in
this package is an internal collaborator that Runner composes -- AgentLoop,
ToolExecutor, ContextAssembler, ModelClient. That visibility boundary is the
entire point of Runner: it is what lets Phase 2 replace the loop with an
orchestrator without any caller noticing.

Since M12, `Runner.start()` starts a run and returns a `RunHandle` for it at once,
through which a caller streams the run's events, reads its state, awaits its
result or cancels it. `Runner.run()` is a run started that way and awaited.
