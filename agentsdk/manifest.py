"""Execution manifest (FR-11, ADR-25, LLD 2.4).

A per-run snapshot of exactly what configuration produced it: SDK version, spec
and instruction hashes, model and adapter versions, tool schema hashes, policy
version -- and, since M9, the output limit, reasoning effort and prices the run
used (FR-31), and since M11 the scheduler limits it executed under (FR-43).

Nothing reads it in Phase 0. It is written from the start so that "what
produced this run" is answerable during debugging today, and so Phase 8's
compatibility gating has a history to gate against rather than starting from an
empty table.
