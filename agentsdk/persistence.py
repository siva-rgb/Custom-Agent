"""Wiring that turns the in-memory Runner into a persisted one (M5).

`Persistence` is a small bundle rather than four constructor arguments, so that
`Runner(..., persistence=Persistence.postgres(dsn))` is the whole opt-in. With
no persistence the Runner behaves exactly as before, in memory: Phase 0 must
stay runnable without a database, or every test needs one.
