"""Stable exception hierarchy (FR-13, master design 4.11).

Three families under one root, so callers can catch at whatever altitude they
mean: `AgentSDKError` for anything this SDK raised, `ToolError` for anything a
tool call did, or one concrete class.

Names are prefixed (`ModelTimeout`, `ToolTimeout`) because the design lists a
`Timeout` under both `ModelError` and `ToolError`; the prefix keeps the two
distinguishable at an import site without nesting classes.
