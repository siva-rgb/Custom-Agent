"""M6 gate: the golden eval (AC-1..AC-4, AC-9, AC-10, NFR-3, NFR-4, NFR-7).

One task, one tool set, one set of assertions -- run twice: once against a
scripted ModelClient so every path is exercised on every run, and once against
each live provider AC-9 names. Each acceptance criterion is asserted on its own
terms rather than inferred from the final status, because SPEC.md names "a
single golden eval carrying three assertions may pass for the wrong reason" as
a risk of exactly this file.

AC-3 IS exercised live. An earlier version of this file argued it could not be,
on the grounds that a validation failure cannot be driven by prompting: asked
to call echo with the number 42, openai.gpt-4o-mini sends 42 and trips
validation while bedrock.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5 coerces it to "42". That
measurement was real but the conclusion generalised from a single shape. A
constraint the instructed input CANNOT satisfy -- register_code advertises
maxLength 8 and the task supplies 36 characters -- fails validation on both
providers, 4 runs out of 4, with the implementation never invoked. Found by the
M6 reviewer; reproduced here before being believed.

The assertions deliberately target the property each criterion names rather
than something adjacent to it:

  * AC-2's "surfaced to the model" is asserted on what the model was actually
    SENT -- on the canonical request in the scripted half, and on the wire
    bytes in the live half, over every error result the run stored.
  * AC-4's "fully populated" is asserted over every field ContentProvenance
    declares, read off the dataclass, not over a list of field names.
  * AC-9's "unchanged" is asserted against what the live runs actually used,
    not against specs this file rebuilds for itself afterwards.
  * AC-10 scans whole rows across every table, not an enumerated column list.
  * NFR-4 is asserted on the wire body, not on the ModelRequest object.
  * NFR-7's "never read" is asserted by showing the decision does not change
    with the principal, not by checking an error type.

Every one of those was previously asserted one step removed from its claim, and
the tests passed for reasons weaker than the claims they underwrote. Three of
them survived a round of that correction and had to be found again -- the shape
is easier to remove from the test you are looking at than from the file.
