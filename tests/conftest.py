"""Checks that span the whole test session.

AC-44 / NFR-16 (M11): a full regression run leaves the store as it found it.
Before Phase 2 the golden-eval tests left 13 runs behind on every full run --
measured on 2026-09-14 against the M11 baseline -- and each file's own cleanup
could not see what another file left. So the set of run ids in every run-scoped
table is taken when the session starts and compared when it ends: a run added,
or one removed that the suite did not write, fails the session.

With no database configured this fails rather than skips (AC-19's rule): a
check that skips to green proves nothing.
